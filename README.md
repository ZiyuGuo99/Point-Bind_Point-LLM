## Point-Bind

With a joint embedding space of 3D and multi-modality, our Point-Bind empowers four promising applications:

## Point-LLM

Using Point-Bind, we introduce Point-LLM, ***the first 3D LLM*** that responds to instructions with 3D point cloud conditions, supporting both English and Chinese. Our Point-LLM exhibits two main characters:

- $\color{darkorange}{Data\ and\ Parameter\ Efficiency\ .}$ We only utilize public vision-language data for tuning without any 3D instruction data, and adopt parameter-efficient finetuning techniques, saving extensive resources.

- $\color{darkorange}{3D\ and\ MultiModal\ Reasoning.}$ Via the joint embedding space, Point-LLM can generate descriptive responses by reasoning a combination of 3D and multimodal input, e.g., a point cloud with an image/audio.

</p>

The overall pipeline of Point-LLM is as follows. We efficiently fine-tune [LLaMA 7B](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) for 3D instruction-following capacity referring to [LLaMA-Adapter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16199.pdf%20%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C5%BE%3Emultimodalno%C3%85%E2%80%BA%C3%84%E2%80%A1%3C/a%3E,%C3%82%C2%A0%3Ca%20href=) and [ImageBind-LLM](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter):

## Getting Started
Please refer to [Install.md](https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Point-Bind_Point-LLM/blob/main/Install.md) for preparing environments and pre-trained checkpoints.

### 3D with Multi-modalities

We provide simple inference scripts to verify the embedding alignment for 3D and other modalities in Point-Bind.

#### Compare 3D with Text
Run `python demo_text_3d.py` with input:
```
text_list = ['An airplane', 'A car', 'A toilet']
point_paths = ["examples/airplane.pt", "examples/car.pt", "examples/toilet.pt"]
```
Output the similarity matrix:
```
Text x Point Cloud
tensor([[1.0000e+00, 6.5731e-09, 6.5958e-10],
        [1.7373e-06, 9.9998e-01, 1.7816e-05],
        [2.1133e-10, 3.4070e-08, 1.0000e+00]])
```

#### Compare 3D with Audio
Run `python demo_audio_3d.py` with input:
Input
```
audio_paths = ["examples/airplane_audio.wav", "examples/car_audio.wav", "examples/toilet_audio.wav"]
point_paths = ["examples/airplane.pt", "examples/car.pt", "examples/toilet.pt"]
```
Output the similarity matrix:
```
Audio x Point Cloud: 
tensor([[0.9907, 0.0041, 0.0051],
        [0.0269, 0.9477, 0.0254],
        [0.0057, 0.0170, 0.9773]])
```

### 3D Zero-shot Tasks
For 3D zero-shot classification, please follow [DATASET.md](https://github.com/lulutang0608/Point-BERT/blob/master/DATASET.md) to download ModelNet40, and put it under `data/modelnet40_normal_resampled/`. Then run `bash scripts/pointbind_i2pmae.sh` or `bash scripts/pointbind_pointbert.sh` for Point-Bind with I2P-MAE or Point-BERT encoder.

Zero-shot classification accuracy comparison:
|  Model | Encoder | ModeNet40 (%)|
| :-----: | :-----: |:-----:|
|  [PointCLIP](https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/PointCLIP) | 2D CLIP |20.2|
|  [ULIP](https://github.com/salesforce/ULIP) | Point-BERT |60.4|
|  [PointCLIP V2](https://github.com/yangyangyang127/PointCLIP_V2) | 2D CLIP |64.2|
|  [ULIP 2](https://github.com/salesforce/ULIP) | Point-BERT |66.4|
|  Point-Bind | [Point-BERT](https://github.com/lulutang0608/Point-BERT) |76.3|
|  Point-Bind | [I2P-MAE](https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/I2P-MAE) |**78.0**|
